Easy Question:
Write a Java program to simulate a ticket queueing system. Implement a Queue data structure to manage the queue. The program should have the following functionalities:

Enqueue: Add a new ticket to the queue.
Dequeue: Remove the next ticket from the queue.
Display: Print the current queue of tickets.
Expected Output:
Enqueue Ticket 1
Enqueue Ticket 2
Enqueue Ticket 3
Dequeue Ticket
Display Queue: [Ticket 2, Ticket 3]

Hard Question:
Given an array of integers, implement a Java program to find the smallest subarray length whose sum is greater than a given target value. Use a Queue data structure to solve this problem efficiently.

Example:
Array: [4, 2, 1, 7, 8, 1, 2, 8, 10]
Target: 14

Expected Output:
Smallest subarray length: 2

Explanation: The subarray [7, 8] has a sum of 15, which is greater than the target value of 14. The length of this subarray is 2, which is the smallest length among all subarrays with a sum greater than the target.
